### Import

import keyword is used to import built-in and user-defined packages into your source file so that your class can refer to a
class that is in another package by directly using its name.

### Include

include directive makes the compiler go to the standard library and copy the code from the header files into the program. 

```
There is no #include in java., although you can import classes from other packages. Making seperate class func.java to store 
variables might not be a good idea, until or unless all of them are constants. By extending some class, you can reuse the 
function.
```
