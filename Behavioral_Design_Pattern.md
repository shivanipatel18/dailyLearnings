# Behavioral Design Pattern

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, 
 State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor

### Use Case of Behavioral Design Pattern-

1) Template pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation deferring some steps to sub-classes, Template method 
lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure. say for an example in your 
project you want the behavior of the module can be extended, such that we can make the module behave in new and different ways
as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications. However, No one is allowed to make 
source code changes to it. it means you can add but canâ€™t modify the structure in those scenarios a developer can approach 
template design pattern.
