# Programming paradigms

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.

### Common programming paradigms include:-

A.Imperative - in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,\
  1.procedural which groups instructions into procedures,\
  2.object-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,
  
B.Declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it\
  1.functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,\
  2.logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,\
  3.mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem

### Functional Programming

In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. 

Characteristics of Functional Programming\
-Functional programming method focuses on results, not the process\
-Emphasis is on what is to be computed\
-Data is immutable\
-Functional programming Decompose the problem into functions\
-It is built on the concept of mathematical functions which uses conditional expressions and recursion to do perform the calculation\
-It does not support iteration like loop statements and conditional statements like If-Else

## Function as a First-Class Citizen:-

A programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.

## Higher-Order Function

A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
- takes one or more functions as arguments or
- returns a function as its result.
