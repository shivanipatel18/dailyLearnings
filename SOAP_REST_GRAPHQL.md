SOAP:-

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers. 
SOAP is an application of the XML specification.

Main points:-
-SOAP is a communication protocol designed to communicate via Internet.

-SOAP can extend HTTP for XML messaging.

-SOAP provides data transport for Web services.

-SOAP can exchange complete documents or call a remote procedure.

-SOAP can be used for broadcasting a message.

-SOAP is platform- and language-independent.

-SOAP is the XML way of defining what information is sent and how.

-SOAP enables client applications to easily connect to remote services and invoke remote methods.

REST:-

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architecture style that relies on a stateless communications
protocol, most commonly, HTTP. REST structures data in XML, YAML, or any other format that is machine-readable, but usually 
JSON is most widely used. REST follows the object-oriented programming paradigm of noun-verb. REST is very data-driven, 
compared to SOAP, which is strongly function-driven

GRAPHQL:-

GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client.
GraphQL has three main characteristics:
 -It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
 -It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
 -It uses a type system to describe data.
 
With GraphQL, the user is able to make a single call to fetch the required information rather than to construct several REST
 requests to fetch the same.
