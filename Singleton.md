# Singleton Class

A singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one. Since there is only one Singleton instance, any instance fields of a Singleton will occur only once per class, just like static fields.

Singleton class 
```
// File Name: Singleton.java
public class Singleton {

   private static Singleton singleton = new Singleton( );

   /* A private Constructor prevents any other
    * class from instantiating.
    */
   private Singleton() { }

   /* Static 'instance' method */
   public static Singleton getInstance( ) {
      return singleton;
   }

   /* Other methods protected by singleton-ness */
   protected static void demoMethod( ) {
      System.out.println("demoMethod for singleton");
   }
}
```

Main program file where we will create a singleton object :âˆ’

```
// File Name: SingletonDemo.java
public class SingletonDemo {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Singleton tmp = Singleton.getInstance( );
      tmp.demoMethod( );
   }
}
```
